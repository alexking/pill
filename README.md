## SmartThings Pill Reminder

SmartThings has a great app for medication reminders, but you have to use a medicine cabinet for it to be accurate (it knows you've taken it if you've opened the cabinet). So I decided to build a little device to hold a pill bottle, and blink brightly when they aren't taken on time.

This project is [provided as is, etc., etc](https://gist.github.com/alexking/7852271). It isn't fit for any particular purpose, such as (but not limitted to) reminding you to take your medication. You're still going to want to remember that with your head.
