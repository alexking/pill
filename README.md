### SmartThings Pill Reminder

SmartThings has a great app for medication reminders, but you have to use a medicine cabinet for it to be accurate (it knows you've taken it if you've opened the cabinet). So I decided to build a little device to hold a pill bottle, and blink brightly when they aren't taken on time.

* [Device Type](pillbug/pillbug-device-type.groovy)
* Needs a SmartApp to drive it
